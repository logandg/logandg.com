## My Projects

### [UseMySongs](https://usemysongs.com)
UseMySongs is my current full-time startup that I'm helping co-found. It's a music licensing platform to connect musicians (mostly independent) to new media creators (currently just YouTubers).

### [Roach](https://roach.it)
Roach is my perpetual labor of love side project. The idea is that we can uniquely identify "elements" of the internet like a paragraph on a blog, an image in a news article or something like a Facebook post. Roach is code to uniquely identify and link to those "elements" combined with a social network of sorts to vote/comment on them.

### [Flip](https://whatisflip.com)
Flip is a classifieds app we built because we weren't happy with existing mobile classifieds solutions. We thought the mobile platform could allow a lot of safety and convenience features for something like local classifieds.

Turns out building a mobile app with a two-sided marketplace from the ground up is really hard. Now we are taking what we've built and are turning it into a platform to license out to publishers with an existing audience (like local newspapers).
